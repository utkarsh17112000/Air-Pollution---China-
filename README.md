# 🌫️ Air Pollution Analysis – Excel + SQL Project

A complete end-to-end analysis of a multi-city air pollution dataset, performed using Excel, Pivot Tables, and SQL. This project explores pollutant trends, meteorological impacts, AQI behavior, seasonal patterns, and city-wise pollution insights.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

Pollutant Data

PM2.5 (µg/m³)

PM10 (µg/m³)

## 📊 Key Insights

Spring & Winter recorded the highest extreme pollution events (AQI > 300).

6 AM AQI levels were worse than 6 PM across cities.

Correlation between AQI and weather variables (humidity, wind, temperature) was very weak.

Some cities consistently fell into Unhealthy or Very Unhealthy AQI categories.
